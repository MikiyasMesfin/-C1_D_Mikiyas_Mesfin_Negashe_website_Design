    <div id="main"><p>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and
        engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”. Artificial
        Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think
        intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. AI is accomplished by studying
        how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a
        problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software
        and systems.[1]
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed by
        representations that support models targeted at thinking, perception and action. Where an
        Algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a particular problem. A model is a
        representation of entities and relationships between them. For example a Computer model, can
        be a simulation used to reproduce behavior of a system, which in turn can be used to make
        predictions.

    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI): A broad discipline with the goal of creating intelligent machines, as
        opposed to the natural intelligence that is demonstrated by humans and animals. AI is the theory
        and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human
        intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation
        between languages.
        AI is the creation of a computer program that can learn to think and function on its own, kind of
        like robots that don’t need to be told what to do all the time. In the modern age, AI is the enabler
        technology. The following are technologies that uses AI:</p>
        <ol><li> Machine Learning – A subset of AI that often uses statistical techniques to give
            machines the ability to "learn" from data without being explicitly given the instructions
            for how to do so. This process is known as “training” a “model” using a learning
            “algorithm” that progressively improves model performance on a specific task.</li>
           <li>  Robotics – Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as
            well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
            These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and
            replicate human actions.</li>
            <li> Machine Automation – Machine automation is any Information Technology (IT) that
                designed to control the work of machines.</li>
           <li>  Virtual Reality – Virtual Reality is the computer-generated simulation of a threedimensional
            image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or
            physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a
            screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.</li>
           <li>  Cloud Computing – Cloud Computing the practice of using a network of remote servers
            hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a
            personal computer. Cloud Compuing involves delivering hosted services over the
            Internet. These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-
            Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).</li>
           <li>  Augmented Reality – Augmented Reality refers to a technology that superimposes a
            computer-generated image with sound, text and effects on a user's view of the real world,
            thus enhancing the user’s real world experience.</li>
           <li>  Neural Networks – A neural network is a type of machine learning which models itself
            after the human brain. This creates an artificial neural network that via an algorithm
            allows the computer to learn by incorporating new data.</li>
           <li>  Big Data/ Internet Of Things(IoT) – Big Data refers to extremely large data sets that
            may be analysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially
            relating to human behaviour and interactions. Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the set of
            devices and systems that interconnect real-world sensors and actuators to the Internet.</li>
           <li>  Computer Vision: Enabling machines to analyse, understand and manipulate images and
            video</li></ol>

        <p> The modern AI is based on ‘machine learning’ that enables software to perform difficult tasks
more effectively by learning through training instead of following sets of rules. Deep learning, a
subset of machine learning, is alos delivering breakthrough results in fields including computer
vision and language processing.[3]
Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like
humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must
have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement
knowledge engineering. Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in
machines is a difficult and tedious task.
Machine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects
of the world, while computer vision is the power to analyze visual inputs with a few subproblems
such as facial, object and gesture recognition.
Robotics is also a major field related to AI. Robots require intelligence to handle tasks such as
object manipulation and navigation, along with sub-problems of localization, motion planning
and mapping. [2]
Components of an AI System include the following:
<ol type="I"><li>Applications: Image recognition, Speech recognition, Chatbots, Natural language
    generation, and Sentiment analysis.</li>
    <li> Types of Models: Deep learning, Machine learning, and Neural Networks.</li>
   <li> Software/Hardware for training and running models: Graphic Processing Units
    (GPUs), Parallel processing tools (like Spark), Cloud data storage and computer
    platforms.</li>
    <li> Programming languages for building models: Python, TensorFlow, Java, and C/C++,
        etc.</li></ol>

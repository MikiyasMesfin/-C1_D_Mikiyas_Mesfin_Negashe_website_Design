    <div id="main"><p>In recent years, accelerated urbanization, globalization and the abundance of products, services
        and information has begun to fundamentally transform our society. As individuals, we are
        experiencing an increasingly complex and demanding environment. In response, mobile
        applications and automated services are being developed, allowing us to more effectively
        navigate this complex new world. All this is made possible by powerful algorithms that are
        slowly acquiring fundamental human-like capabilities, such as vision, speech and navigation.
        Collectively, these computer algorithms are called artificial intelligence (AI). Beyond emulating
        these ordinary human capabilities, AI is quickly moving forward to master more specialized
        tasks performed routinely by human experts.</p> 
      <p>In today's world, technology is also growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different
        new technologies day by day. In the modern world computers and the algorithms that govern
        them are seen everywhere; from the smartphones in our pockets, to the transportation systems we
        ride to work, to the computers that control our economy and banks. Many of these algorithms fall
        under the general umbrella of the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial Intelligence is a
        field that originally was founded by computer scientists in the 1950s but has since become a
        multidisciplinary field with applications in nearly every aspect of human life.</p>
        <p>The field of Artificial Intelligence was initially founded to answer the question: is it possible to
            build a machine that has intelligence, specifically a human level of intelligence. A necessary step
            in the pursuit of creating a machine intelligence was understanding the very nature of knowledge
            representation, reasoning, learning, perception, and problem solving. Through an
            understanding of these areas AI researchers discovered much narrower applications that a
            machine can perform and the field of artificial intelligence was expanded. And now Artificial
            Intelligence (AI) is one of the fascinating and universal fields of Computer Science which has a
            great scope in future, which holds a tendency to cause a machine to work as a human.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming many aspects of our personal and professional lives,
        from logistics systems that select the fastest shipping routes to dig-ital assistants that unlock
        doors, turn on lights, and get to know our shopping preferences. The most advanced AI
        systems use machine learning technology to analyze current conditions and learn from
        experience. Within the workplace, these self-directed agents are giving rise to the
        intelligent enterprise: organizations where people make decisions with the help of intelligent
        machines.</p></div>

    <h1>History of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>It all started with Augusta Ada Lovelace (1842), the world's first programmer, who wrote
        programs about 100 years before there were computers to run them. And she said, “The
        analytical engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to
        order it to perform.” And then nothing much happened until about 1950, when Alan Turing
        46
        wrote his famous paper, which introduced the Turing Test. And then the modern era really
        began with a paper written by Marvin Minsky in 1960, titled “Steps Toward Artificial
        Intelligence.” The following section summarizes the short history of AI.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1956 The term “artificial intelligence” is coined by John McCharty at a Dartmouth
                conference and AI is founded as an academic discipline.</li>
               <li> 1956–1974 The golden years of AI enjoy government funding in promising, logic-based
                problem-solving approaches.</li>
               <li> 1974–1980 Overly high expectations coupled with the limited capacities of AI rograms leads
                to the first “AI winter”, with reduced funding and interest in AI research.</li>
                <li> 1987 The rise of knowledge-based expert systems brings new successes and a change in
                the focus of research and funding toward this form of AI.</li>
                <li> 1987–1993 The second “AI winter” starts with the sudden collapse of the specialized
                hardware industry in 1987. The AI hype brings with it negative perceptions by
                governments and investors, as expert systems show their limitations and prove
                expensive to update and maintain.</li>
                <li>1993–2011 Optimism about AI returns and increases. New successes are marked with the
                help of increased computational power and AI becomes data-driven. In 1997,
                IBM’s DeepBlue beats world champion Gary Kasparov at chess. In 2002,
                Amazon uses automated systems to provide recommendations. In 2011, Apple
                releases Siri and IBM Watson beats two human champions at the TV quiz
                Jeopardy.</li>
               <li>2012–today Increased availability of data, connectedness and computational power allow for
                breakthroughs in machine learning, mainly in neural networks and deep learning,
                heralding a new era of increased funding and optimism about the AI potential. In
                2012, Google driverless cars navigate autonomously and in 2016 Google
                AlphaGo beats a world champion in the complicated board game Go.</li>
